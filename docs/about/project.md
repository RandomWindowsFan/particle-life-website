# About this Project

The original idea for Particle Life is by [Jeffrey Ventrella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Ventrella), who called it "Clusters".

I see my contribution as follows. I did
- simplify the rules of Particle Life while keeping its complex behavior
- [explain](https://youtu.be/scvuli-zcRc) those rules in a simple and formal way
- create the [Java framework](/java-framework/overview), being the first implementation of Particle Life to apply space partitioning
- create the [Desktop App](/app/installation)
- create the [Terminal App](/cli/installation)
- create this website
